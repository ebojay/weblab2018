      <p class="bio">From a young age, I’ve always had a camera attached to my hip. Storytelling through movies, pictures and writing has always been a passion of mine.  I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Business of Motion Pictures with minors in Public Relations, Interactive Design and Theater with plans to graduate in May 2018. In January 2015, during my freshman year, I started my bikini line Alani Apparel, which now ships worldwide. I love learning new skills and trying new projects as I’m still finding my place in the world of Creatives. I hope you enjoy!</p>
