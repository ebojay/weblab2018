          <h1>Effects of Meditation and Mindfulness</h1>
          <h2>You'll stop limiting yourself</h2>
          <p>When people practice meditation, we often begin to recognize a specific sort of condition response - previously undetected restrictions we've imposed on our lives. We spot the ways we sabatoge our own growth and success because we've been conditioned to be
          contempt with meager results. Meditation allows us to see that these limits aren't inherent or immutable they were learned
          and they can be unlearned - but not until we recognize them. </p>

          <h2>You'll weather hard times better</h2>
          <p>Meditation teaches us safe ways to open ourselfs to the full range of experience - painful, pleasurable, and nuetral - so we
          can learn how to be a friend to ourselves in good times and bad. During meditation sessions we practice being with difficult
        emotions and thoughts. even frightening or intense ones, in an open and accepting way, without adding self criticism to something that already hurts.</p>

        <h2>You'll  rediscover a deeper sense of what's really important to you.</h2>
        <p>Once you look beneath distractions and conditioned reactions, you'll have a clearer view of your deepest, most enduring dreams, goals and values.
          Meditation practive cultivates qualities such as kindness, trust, and wisdom that you may think are missing from your make up but are actually
          just undeveloped or obscured by stress and distractions. You'll have the chance to access these qualities more easily and frequently</p>

      <h3><small>Less stress. Reverse the aging process. Rapid memory recall improves. More creativity and new ideas.</small></h3>
