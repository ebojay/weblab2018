        <h2>Concentration "Focused Attention"</h2>
        <p>Hold attention on a primary object, usually your breath

          That's it! <small>Many</small></p>

          <h2>Mindfulness "Open Monitoring"</h2>
          <p>Watch your thoughts, let them come and go,
            without reacting, judging or holding on. <small>Buddhism</small></p>

            <h2>Attending "Open Monitoring"</h2>
            Concentrate while carefully naming thoughts, sensations and other mental processes and distractions
          Sit with a deep question in your mind. "Who am I?" is a good one. Explore who is thinking, hearing, seeing, or wondering. What happens in the immediate moment as you ask this question</p>

          <h2>Loving Kindness for Self</h2>
          "Metta Bhvana, cultivation of love"
           Acknowledge whatever you're feeling. Playfully extend loving Kindness
           to yourself by silently expressing feelings like. 'May I be happy/healthy/loved' etc. Maintain this flow of intention. Buddhism.</p>

           <h2> Silent Gratitude </h2>

         <h2>Loving Kindness for Others</h2>
         <p>Picture someone you respect and love. Send a stream of metta (loving kindness) towards them using silent, suitible word. If a feeling of happiness arises, absorb yourself into it. </p>
