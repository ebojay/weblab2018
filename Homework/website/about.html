  <h1>What is Meditation?</h1>

    <main>
      <p class="what">Straightforward and simple (but not easy), meditation is essentially training our attention so that we can be more aware-not only of our own inner workings but also of what's happening aroud us in the here and now. Once we see clearly what's going on in the moment, we can then choose whether and how to act on what's we're seeing. For the next four weeks, we'll be exploring the principles of insight meditation, the simple and direct practice of insight meditation, the simple and direct practice of moment to moment awareness. We first train our attention by focusin on a single chosen object (most often our breath) and repeatedly letting go distractions in order to return our attention to that object. Later we broaden the focus to include whatecer thoughts, feelings, or sensations arise in the moment. In a peverse way, ingoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts ourselves. Assumptions block direct experience and prevent us from gathering information that could bring us comfort and relief, or information that, though saddening and painful, will allow us to make better decisions.
